Project Overview
The Sign Language Interpreter project focuses on leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques to build a system that can recognize and interpret sign language gestures in real-time. This project aims to bridge communication gaps between the Deaf community and the hearing world by providing an accessible, AI-driven translation tool.

Key objectives include:

Collecting and preprocessing sign language datasets.

Training classification models to recognize hand gestures.

Building a pipeline for real-time gesture recognition and translation.
